# python-challenge

## **PyBank**
In this challenge, you are tasked with creating a Python script for analyzing the financial records of your company. You will be given two sets of revenue data. Each dataset is composed of two columns: Date and Revenue.
Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:<br />
<br />
>The total number of months included in the dataset.<br />
>The total amount of revenue gained over the entire period.<br />
>The average change in revenue between months over the entire period.<br />
>The greatest increase in revenue (date and amount) over the entire period.<br />
>The greatest decrease in revenue (date and amount) over the entire period.<br />
<br />
<br />


## **PyBoss**
In this challenge, you get to be the boss. You oversee hundreds of employees across the country developing Tuna 2.0, a world-changing snack food based on canned tuna fish. Alas, being the boss isn't all fun, games, and self-adulation. The company recently decided to purchase a new HR system, and unfortunately for you, the new system requires employee records be stored completely differently.
Your task is to help bridge the gap by creating a Python script able to convert your employee records to the required format. Your script will need to do the following:<br />
>The Name column should be split into separate First Name and Last Name columns.<br />
>The DOB data should be re-written into DD/MM/YYYY format.<br />
>The SSN data should be re-written such that the first five numbers are hidden from view.<br />
>The State data should be re-written as simple two-letter abbreviations.<br />
